# PS5 Games List
### Android Studio/Kotlin Demo
Proof of concept demo to learn coroutines, multithreading, and advanced recyclerviews within android studio using kotlin.\ 
App asynchronously scrapes data from the official Sony Playstation site and loads it into a recyclerview. Each item in the\ recyclerview holds a PS5 game title, description, and image. The data was scraped to provide a quick way to input test data.\
In a real world scenario the data would be pulled from a private database as the app functionality is tied to the website data\ 
not changing.
